It's fully compatible for mobile, tablet and desktop and delivers a preloader to give user's a visual on loading to clarify its loading appropriately.

Technologies Used:

HTML
CSS
Javascript
jQuery
Sass
Gulp

Personal Learnings:

* Implementing grid to set a fixed width of article items at all media queries.

* Using the jSon method 'GET' I was able to grab JSON formatted data.

* Console Log is a one of a developers greatest tools, I used it after methods to verify if my code is reading correctly and give me a response if it is.

* Efficent use of the SASS. In short, Sass is a CSS preprocessor, which adds special features such as variables, nested rules and mixins into regular CSS. The aim was to make the coding process simpler and more efficient.
